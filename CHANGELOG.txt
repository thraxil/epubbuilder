## 0.1.1 - 2013-05-17

* epubs can now be created entirely in memory without requiring a
  directory of source material to exist or an intermediate output
  directory. It can even generate the zip as an in-memory zipfile
  so that doesn't have to be written to disk either.
  This is the basic requirement for using this from inside a
  web app where we don't want to have to deal with the fileystem.
